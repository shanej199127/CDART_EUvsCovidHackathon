We try to create a platform where an app (android/ios) which risk profile based on your location. i.e. moving from Hochtaunuskreis to Maintaunus Kreis your risk goes up since there are more infected people in MTK than in HG. Add some info on Hospital availability on top to complete the risk profile for travellers. 

Providing a risk-assessment tool to businesses determining a) who could go back to work based on low risk profile and b) which customer would be allowed to enter store based on risk profile. Risk profile will depend on location/distances traveled in a given time period/people surrounding the person
